A lovely retelling of the myth of [Ariadne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariadne).
It's a first-person narrative, switching between Ariadne and her sister Phaedra.

I don't remember much of the original mythology, but that wasn't an issue.
All the main characters get introduced as they appear, so I didn't feel I was missing out, and I think it adds a lot of its own detail and colour.

It reminds me of [*Here, the World Entire*](/reviews/here-the-world-entire/) -- both feminist retellings of Greek myths about women.
We see Ariadne and Phaedra advocating for themselves, but also reflecting on the way other women have been treated by the Greek gods.
