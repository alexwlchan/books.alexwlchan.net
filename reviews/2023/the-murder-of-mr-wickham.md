A fun mystery novel featuring a bunch of Austen characters.

I think it would help if I knew who anybody except the Darcys are; although their major arcs are explained in the text, I didn't have an intuitive sense of most of the relationships.
I was able to follow along, but it's probably easier for people who already know Jane Austen's work.

Fortunately the two main characters are new for this book: Juliet Tilney and Jonathan Darcy, two young people who try to investigate the murder themselves.
I enjoyed them both, and their bemusal at adult social customs.

Pleasant enough, not amazing.
