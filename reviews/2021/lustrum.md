I read part of this book for a LAMDA exam -- but if I read the rest of it at the time, I've completely forgotten it.

It's a historical novel that tells the story of Cicero, from his appointment as consul to his exile from Rome.
The book is a first-person account from Tiro, one of his slaves.
Apparently it's the second book of a trilogy, but it's quite readable as a standalone book.

This was fine.
I didn't dislike it, I didn't love it.

I wouldn't mind reading the other two books at some point (*Imperium* and *Dictator*), but probably borrowed from the library rather than owned.
