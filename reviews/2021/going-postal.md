Apparently this was recommended by Emily Meredith, but I'm sure she's not the only one -- people have been suggesting Pratchett to me for years.
I finally picked it up after marvelling at the real-world post office, and seeing it in the library catalogue.

This was my first Pratchett book: the story of a criminal who's offered a choice between death or running the post office.
Of course, his unconventional skills and approach turn it into a roaring success, the post office returns to glory, and his rivals are humiliated.

It's a fun book, cleverly structured, and funny -- I can see why Pratchett is popular.
I'm sure I'll read more, and a quick Google suggests *Making Money* is the next one to read.

The narration is good, with a wide variety of voices that capture the different characters.
