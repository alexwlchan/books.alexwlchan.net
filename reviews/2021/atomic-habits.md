I first heard of this book in a [tweet from Hynek](https://twitter.com/hynek/status/1259536982411280386).

It introduces the "four laws of behaviour change":

1. Make it obvious
2. Make it attractive
3. Make it easy
4. Make it satisfying

and then explains each of them in more detail.
There are lots of stories and examples to help motivate the theory, which is well-explained without becoming repetitive.

Time will tell whether I can put the ideas into practice -- but the theory at least I very much enjoyed.
