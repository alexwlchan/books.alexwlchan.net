A Cold War spy thriller crossed with a murder mystery – an Apollo 18 mission intended to spy on the Soviets, which ends up going very wrong.
I enjoyed it and read it quickly.

It's driven more by the plot than the characters, but that works here.
Chris Hadfield's knowledge of space shines through – there's lots of detail, and it feels authentic to how something like this might happen.
(I got strong vibes reminding me of *For All Mankind*.)

I don't know if I'll want to re-read it, but I'm glad past!me ordered it in February as an unexpected surprise for present!me.
