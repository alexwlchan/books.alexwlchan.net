A collection of short sci-fi stories.
I listened to the first four and part of the fifth, but it didn't grab me.

I think I'd enjoy it more if I read it, rather than listening to it â€“ I need to go back and re-read names, and in some of the dialogue I was struggling to tell which character was talking.

I'd like to revisit this, but not as an audiobook.
