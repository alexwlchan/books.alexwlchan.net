Good collection of photos of these trains, taken from a variety of locations and angles.
I especially enjoyed the photos of them looking grimy or worn down â€“ a stark contrast to the glamour shots I usually see.
Plus I finally know how the boiler fits into an A4!
(A hatch under the front slope that reveals a conventional boiler.)

The photos anterspersed with a few interesting facts, like their blackout paint for wartime or the fake photographs that were staged (to make it seem like Britain had more steam engines, maybe?).
