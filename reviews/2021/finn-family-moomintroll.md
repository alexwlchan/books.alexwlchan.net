A fun collection of seven short stories about the Moomins and their various friends.
Apparently this is the third Moomin book that was published, so it seems to assume that you know who all the major characters are â€“ but I was able to read it quite easily despite not having read the prior books.

I picked this up as one of several Tove Jansson books from the Oxfam shop (see also: [*The Invisible Child and the Fir Tree*](/reviews/the-invisible-child-and-the-fir-tree/)), and I've been reading a chapter or two a night.
