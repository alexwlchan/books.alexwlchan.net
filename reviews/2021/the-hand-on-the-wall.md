The sequel to [*Truly Devious*](/reviews/truly-devious/) and [*The Vanishing Stair*](/reviews/the-vanishing-stair/).
Continuing the murder mystery at Ellingham Academy.

The writing and narration style are very similar to the previous books -- switching between the present day and the 1930s, when the initial crimes took place.
I enjoyed this book more than the previous two, because we get some answers.
Although there is a sequel, I don't feel I was left hanging to find out who was responsible for the various murders.

Fun, enjoyable, I listened to it quickly.
