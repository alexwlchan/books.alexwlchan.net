This is another one of the Moomin books I got from Oxfam; in hindsight, I should have read this before [*Finn Family Moomintroll*](/reviews/finn-family-moomintroll/), because this book is earlier in the series, and introduces a bunch of the characters (Snufkin, the Hemulen, the Snork Maiden) rather than assume you already know them.

It's a fun story that forms a single narrative, and a good introduction to all the different characters.
