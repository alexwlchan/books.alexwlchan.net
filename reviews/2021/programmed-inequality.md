I went to hear a brief reading of this in 2017, apparently, and it's sat on a shelf ever since.
There's a lot of detail and research, and I definitely skimmed some of it -- it felt closer to something academic than what I usually read.
I'm glad I read it, I learnt quite a few new things, and I took plenty of notes.
