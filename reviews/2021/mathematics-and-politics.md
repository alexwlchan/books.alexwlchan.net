I read eight of the twelve chapters, which was enough for now.

This book covers a bunch of ideas around voting and strategy.
Each chapter covers one topic, and it's broken up into easy-to-follow sections.
There are plenty of relevant examples and explanations to follow, and the proofs were well-explained.
(No "ABC is trivial" or "obviously XYZ".)

This is a textbook, and at the end of each chapter there are lots of exercises to help cement the concepts.
I didn't do the exercises -- I just read the prose.

I'd certainly pick this up again if I wanted to do a more in-depth study of the topic.
