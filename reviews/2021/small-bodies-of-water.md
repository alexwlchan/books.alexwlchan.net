I borrowed this audiobook from the library because it looked intriguing.
It's a series of essays about the author's life, marked by bodies of water -- an ocean, a swimming pool, the monsoon floods.

The writing has a certain lyricism, but it failed to grab me.

I don't think it's a bad book, and I'd be open to re-reading it at a future date, but I wouldn't get anything out of finishing for the sake of finishing.
