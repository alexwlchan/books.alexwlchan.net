Patrick Barkham’s account of his attempt to find all 59 species of British butterflies in the summer of 2009. It struck a good balance of detail – I know very little about butterflies, but I was able to follow along, and learnt a fair amount along the way. It’s a lovely account, and gets the happy ending I was hoping for.

I’ve not about to become a full-on butterfly hunter, but I’m left with a renewed appreciation for their diversity and beauty.
