This book covers some general advice for lecturing, both in academic and non-academic contexts.

Most of the advice was familiar to me already, but the refresher was helpful. I suspect I’d have learnt more if I’d read it a few years ago. (Whether this is reflected in my lecturing ability is another thing entirely!)

It’s a bit rambly in parts, and often goes off into case studies that take too long to explain. Like some of the lectures it describes, I think you could edit it down without losing much. I’m unlikely to read it again, but I might skim the chapter summaries.
