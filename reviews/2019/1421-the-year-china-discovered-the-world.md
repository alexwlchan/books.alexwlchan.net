I started this with no context and without knowing who the author was. Interesting enough (and surprisingly, I find it much easier to keep Chinese names straight in my head than English names), but when I bothered to Google and see what other people thought of it, it rapidly killed my interest. (Spoiler: not complimentary.)

I might go back to finish at some point, but it's fallen down my TBR list.
