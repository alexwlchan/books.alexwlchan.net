This is the sequel to [*Written in the Stars*](/reviews/written-in-the-stars/) and [*Hang the Moon*](/reviews/hang-the-moon/), in a way that presumably ties off the trilogy -- all the main characters are now paired off and have their happily ever after.
This romance novel follows Margot connecting with her first love Olivia -- and estranged friend of eleven years -- when a series of coincidences brings them back together.

It's still sweet and charming, but I didn't enjoy it as much as the first two books.
Margot and Olivia already have feelings for one another, and the book is about them learning to talk about it -- rather than watching them fall in love.
I was less invested in their relationship because I never got to see it grow.

I felt more about the friendships between Margot and the established cast, than about the romance between her and Olivia.
We still get flashes of Elle, Darcy, Brendon, and Annie â€“ enough to enjoy, not so much as to be distracting.

I feel like I'm picking nits in a book I still quite enjoyed, and I'm glad to have finished the series -- this sticks the landing for the series as a whole -- but I do think it's the weakest of the three.
