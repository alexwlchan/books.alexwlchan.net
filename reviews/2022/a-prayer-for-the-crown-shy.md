This is the sequel to [*A Psalm for the Wild-Built*](/reviews/a-psalm-for-the-wild-built/).

Dex and Mosscap go wandering through various settlements on Panga -- and experience a variety of reactions to a robot, from distrust to excitement to curiosity.
Mosscap's interest is a deft way to show us how this world works; we see the mechanics through his ever-curious eyes, not an exposition dump.

They're both trying to answer the question: "What do we need?"

There are some nice moments that I've come to expect from a Becky Chambers book (I was particularly struck by Mosscap's attitude towards fishing), but it felt like less than the sum of its parts.
There are good passages, but I wasn't gripped by the story overall.
