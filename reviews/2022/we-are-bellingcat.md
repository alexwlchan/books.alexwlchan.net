This was a gift from Mum, although I don't remember exactly when.

It's about an investigative journalism group [Bellingcat], who do fact checking and investigation based on "open-source information" -- looking at information from publicly accessible sources, like social media and online maps.
The book explains how Eliot went from being a blogger to leading the group, which has worked on an impressive list of cases -- including the downing of MH17, the poisoning of the Skripals in Salisbury, and the Syrian civil war.

It's quite a thrilling story, bouncing from case to case, explaining what they were able to find -- and often, the people who didn't want them to find it.
The Russian secret service makes multiple appearances.

A fun and enjoyable read.
