This is the sequel to [*Before the Coffee Gets Cold*](/reviews/before-the-coffee-goes-cold/) and [*Tales from the Café*](/reviews/before-the-coffee-gets-cold-tales-from-the-cafe/).
It's another beautiful collection of stories, that continue to push the boundaries of the mechanic, and I cried buckets at each of them.

* an orphan who wants to go back and rebuke her parents, for the difficult life she had after they died when she was young
* a comedian who goes back in time to tell his dead wife about winning an award she always wanted for him
* a sister who travels forward to make sure her older sister won't be sad after her pending death
* a young man who travels back to profess his love to a friend, when he only realises his feelings after she leaves for America for lifesaving treatment

And alongside them is a rich cast of café regulars (although different from the previous two books; it's a new café), who help guide these people as they decide whether to travel in time.

I think it leans more on knowledge of the prior books and the mechanics, and I think that's to its advantage -- it gets to go deeper on the character moments, which is where this book really shines.
It's a little fairytale at points, but it works for me.

A fine addition to the series.
