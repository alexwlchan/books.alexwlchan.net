This is a grim, dystopian sci-fi novel with some beautiful imagery.
It's set in a totalitarian state, following a spaceship engineer who's tempted by a woman to break the law.

I'm not sure "enjoy" is the right word for this, but some of the imagery and ideas are wonderful.

There's an introduction that explains some historical context: when Zamyatin lived, and the world he was imagining, which was very useful.
