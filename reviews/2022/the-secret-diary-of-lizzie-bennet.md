This is the companion book to [*The Lizzie Bennet Diaries*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lizzie_Bennet_Diaries), which retells Lizzie's story from a slightly more personal perspective.
It's the same events, but now we can see more than what was on camera -- both the background details not worth mentioning, and confidences Lizzie intentionally kept.

I've enjoyed spending time with these characters again, and seeing a bit more of their world.
I particularly liked Mr Bennet, who's quite a funny character -- but the book gives everyone more depth and nuance than the videos alone.
Both Lydia and Jane's storylines hit a lot harder now than I remember.
(Although some of that may also be how I've changed in the last decade.)

I read this [after the Lydia book](/reviews/the-epic-adventures-of-lydia-bennet/), and I think that was the wrong order -- this retells the events of LBD, whereas Lydia's book continues after it ends.
It would have more sense to read this book first and remind myself of LBD, then continue Lydia's story.

It was an easy, gentle read that I wanted to finish quickly.
I'm glad I finally read it.
