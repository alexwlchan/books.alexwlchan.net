Cute little book about the seat covers on London's trains, trams, and buses.
There's a two-page spread on most of the patterns, with some information about the designer and the vehicles where it was used.
I read it cover-to-cover and picked up a few interesting stories.

I'm slightly surprised it wasn't harder to read -- I usually struggle with this sort of listicle-like book.
The author is quite generous with credit -- they frequently refer to the designers or other moquette historians, and they don't insert themselves into the narrative much.
It felt like it was meant to be fun and interesting, not to puff up the author's ego.

This was a gift from Coco for my 29th birthday.
