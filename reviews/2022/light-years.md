This is a popular science book about the history of discoveries about light.
It progresses in fairly chronological order, from early history to the present day.

It's a mix of biography and physics that I didn't find too hard to read.
It was interesting, but not unusually so, and I didn't feel compelled to take notes.
I don't have any strong feelings about it.

The bookplate tells me I've had this on my shelf for fourteen (!) years, and I'm glad I can finally tick it off.
