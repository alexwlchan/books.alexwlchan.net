The final book of *All the Wrong Questions*, and it concludes the series as I’ve come to expect from Snicket.

This book only covers a single night, as Snicket leaves the town aboard its train. I found this made the book much tighter and better-paced than some previous editions, where the timing could get a bit wooly. I enjoyed the plot, and consumed it in a single sitting – but I guessed most of the major “reveals” before they hit the page. Most other Snicket books have at least one or two surprising moments, and I didn’t get that from this one.

The story ties off in typical Snicket fashion, a phrase which here means “not actually resolving very much and leaving you with more questions than answers”, but I like the tone of melancholy and uncertainty it leaves. A solid addition to the Snicket canon.
