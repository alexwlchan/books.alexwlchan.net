Some background on the history of chess that I hadnâ€™t come across before, but I was much more interested by the variety of chess sets on display. Dozens of high-quality, colour illustrations of pieces from different cultures and styles, each with some short commentary about their origins. Not too long, but a delightful little book for a chess fan.
