I very much enjoyed this book.

It’s a retelling of classic Norse myths, combining some tales, putting a new spin on others. Each myth is short – maybe 10–20 pages apiece – and aiming for the style of somebody sitting around a campfire. I don’t know how accurate it is to the originals (and as the preface discusses, does that matter?), but I felt myself gripped, and moving from story to story.

I got through it quite quickly (three days) – once I’d started a story, I wanted to see it through to the end – but I couldn’t read more than a couple at a time.

I lent it to Eddie, and he devoured it in the day between visiting me and Dad coming up to see me.
