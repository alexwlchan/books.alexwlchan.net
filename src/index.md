# Welcome to my book tracker!

This is a small app I created to track the books I’m reading. In this app, I can:

*   Write mini-reviews of the [books I’ve read](/reviews/)
*   Keep track of what I’m [currently reading](/reading/)
*   Write down what books [I want to read](/to-read/), and why I want to read them

This was inspired by a [similar book tracker](https://github.com/tessalt/books) created by [Tessa Thornton](https://twitter.com/tessthornton).
