> this blew up so: 1. I wrote a book called How To Be Alone, I recommend buying it from indie bookstores, ideally Black owned indie bookstores. <https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781501178832> 2. KEEP WEARING UR MASKS AND STAYING INSIDE. Even if we feel like gaslit losers, at least we know we're not alone.
