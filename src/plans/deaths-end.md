> Have you read death's end trilogy, cixin liu? Big ideas and Chinese (though obvs I read in translation)

> i really loved reading something set in a culture I know little about. the history of the 60s with the translators notes was fascinating, and the author just introduced it like we all know about struggle sessions. (warning: first chapter is traumatic, it gets less so)
