I found [a preview in Google Books](https://books.google.co.uk/books?ved=2ahUKEwis3_a0pvnnAhXQi1wKHbHTBxAQ6AEwA3oECAoQAQ&lpg=PA61&sig=ACfU3U2M8bIm15Y0naKchPZyRgKEE27yxQ&source=bl&hl=en&id=GdJ7DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA61&sa=X&ots=C6R1S16sPY&dq=%E7%8E%89%20etymology#v=onepage&q=%E7%8E%89%20etymology&f=false) while looking for something else.

Seems more like an academic textbook; over $250! <https://brill.com/view/title/35872>
