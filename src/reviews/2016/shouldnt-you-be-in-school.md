Snicket’s continuing adventures in Stain’d by the Sea. Arson, kidnapping, and a continuation of Hangfire’s plot – I enjoyed it, but there weren’t any particularly memorable scenes for me. I think it’s worth revisiting the other books before you read this – it’s been quite a while since I read book 2, and there were parts that were harder to follow because I’d forgotten details from prior books. (I wouldn’t usually mention that, but I remember ASOUE being very good about that sort of thing.)
