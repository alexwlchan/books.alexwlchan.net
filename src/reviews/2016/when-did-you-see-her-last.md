The sequel to “Who Could That Be at This Hour?” Snicket’s continuing adventures in the town of Stain’d-By-The-Sea, this time following a case of a missing girl who Snicket is hired to find.

Like the first, I enjoyed it and finished it in a single sitting, but it hasn’t left a strong impression on me. I finished it an hour ago, and a lot of the details are already slipping from my mind. Again, I’m feeling like this is ASOUE-lite, in good and bad ways. I’ll pick up the third book at some point, but I don’t feel like I need to read it immediately.
