This was a gift from Coco for my 27th birthday.

Inside stories of various Apple projects, and lessons the author learned.
I particularly enjoyed the story of the iPhone keyboard development, something I'd only heard snippets of in the past.
The key takeaway is well explained, if unsurprising for somebody from Apple: people are the most important part of software development, not cold numbers.
