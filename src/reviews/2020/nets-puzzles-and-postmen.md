This book seems to be an introduction to networks and graph theory, aimed at a non-mathematical reader. I read a couple of chapters and it seems fine, but I’ve done enough graph theory courses that it didn’t seem to have enough new material to be worth reading more of.

I suspect it would appeal to somebody who hasn’t done a graph theory course.
