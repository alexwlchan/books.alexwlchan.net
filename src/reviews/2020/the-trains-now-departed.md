This is a book about aspects of Britain's railways that have been lost and forgotten.
Some chapters focus on a specific line or service, others talk about a particular experience -- say, named services or the dining car.

It's easy to read and flows nicely; it would benefit from a few maps to show what it's talking about.
(I did discover some at the end of the book, but that was a bit late!)

But more than talking about any specific experience, what this book tries to do -- and succeeds in doing -- is convincing you that something has been lost on Britain's railways.
The past wasn't perfect, but there was character and charm that is no longer present today.

This was a gift from Grandma and Granddad for Christmas 2019.
