The sixth book in the H2G2 series, written after Douglas Adams’ death.

I gave up after a few chapters; it wasn’t grabbing me. It felt like a pale imitation of Adams’ style. It would frequently interject with absurd “Guide Notes” which didn’t say anything interesting, just a bit wacky in that style – none of the heart behind the book.

Quote, chapter 7:

> “Listen, odd child. You may learn something.”
> “From you? No thinks. I think I’d rather stay stupid.”
> “Your wish has already been granted.”
