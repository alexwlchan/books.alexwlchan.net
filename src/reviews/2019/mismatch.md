It’s short, but covers a lot of material in its pages:
* How inclusion and exclusion work
* Practical ways for improving inclusion (not just “try harder”), and acknowledging that it’s a process, not a single event
* The idea of persona spectra is a particularly interesting one – that a disability might be permanent, temporary, or situational – as a way to frame designs to think more inclusively

I’ll be keeping it and revisiting it again.
