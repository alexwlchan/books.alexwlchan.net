I picked up this book on the recommendation of a friend, but otherwise I knew nothing about it. Turns out that’s a really good way to read it.

I really enjoyed this book. I’d absolutely recommend it, doubly so if you can go in knowing nothing.

It has thoughtful, well-crafted aliens; a nuanced treatment of gender, pronouns and prejudice; and a crew who are likeable but not perfect. What was great was that I had no idea what was coming – in many ways, the book is like a breath of fresh air in a genre that’s still depressingly male and human-centric. I think this one will stick with me for a while.
