Meh. I got about halfway through before giving up.

I bought this in a charity shop a few years ago because the blurb sounded interesting, but it never grabbed me. It’s part of a multi-book arc about the collapse of the multiverse. Potentially exciting, but it deflates the tension, because I can be pretty sure the book doesn’t end with the collapse of the multiverse. It relies on the reader knowing the previous continuity – difficult for me, as I haven’t read any other books in the series.

Halfway through, I still wasn't really sure what was going on, who the major characters were, or the major plot events. I’ll be taking it back to the charity shop.
