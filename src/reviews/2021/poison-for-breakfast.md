I first heard of this in [a review by The Snicket Sleuth](https://snicketsleuth.tumblr.com/post/661507207111819264/the-sleuth-reviews-poison-for-breakfast), and I borrowed the ebook from the library.

It's a very Snicket-y Snicket book, with the usual mix of profundity and absurdity, this time in the frame of a murder mystery.
I enjoyed it, but I wasn't carried by the plot as in some of the previous books.
It's fine.
