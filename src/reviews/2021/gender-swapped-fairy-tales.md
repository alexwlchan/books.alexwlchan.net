The text differences are much lighter touch than I was expecting -- it's apparently a sophisticated find and replace, but with no more editorialising than that.
Any imbalances are lifted directly from the original text.

The hardback version has gorgeous illustrations, and feels like a proper book of fairy tales.
It's a book with presence and heft.

I enjoyed this both for the gender shenanigans, and for reading an older version of some of the fairy tales I'm used to.
