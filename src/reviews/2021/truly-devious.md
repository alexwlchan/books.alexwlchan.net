A fun murder mystery that I borrowed from the library.
Stevie Bell goes to the Ellingham school, which was the site of an unsolved kidnap and murder in 1936.
She's interested in solving crimes and fancies herself as a detective, and wants to try to crack the case.

The characters felt realistic and the mystery had me intrigued.
I didn't realise this was part of a series when I started, and the mystery isn't resolved by the end.
I've already borrowed the next book from the library.

Easy listen, distinct voices, I got through it quickly.
(Although I had to use Smart Speed in Overcast -- the narrator was very slow.)
