This book is the story of Richard Hayes, a Dublin librarian who was involved in code-breaking during the World War Two.
I borrowed the audiobook when I saw it at the library, and what I listened to was very good – as well as Richard Hayes himself, it gives the broader context of espionage in Ireland during the war.

It's very detailed, and unfortunately that scuppered me – I don't think dense history is a good fit for me and audiobooks.
I'd like to read this again, but in a written form, where I can take notes and skim back and forth quickly.
