I borrowed a copy of this from the library; it's been on my reading list for a while.

It was a good, short listen – I learnt a bunch of stuff about Black British history that I didn't know before, from the Romans and Tudors all the way to the *Empire Windrush*.
It was more a collection of names and topics to go and research in more detail, rather than a detailed reference -- but that may be because I listened to the abridged version.

I listened to it in a day; it's interesting stuff I feel like I should know.
