A fun fantasy story, with echoes of [*The Night Circus*](/2020/the-night-circus/) or [*The Starless Sea*](/2020/the-starless-sea/).
I didn't enjoy it quite as much as either of those books â€“ it was quite slow and took me a while to get going, but I was enjoying it more towards the end.

The worldbuilding is lovely and I enjoyed the story -- and I like that a lot of it is left deliberately unexplained.
The way it builds the plot is clever, doling out bits of the story in a particular order to get your sympathies going in the right direction.
I think it would benefit from re-reading at some point.
