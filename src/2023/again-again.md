This is an interesting book with aspects of a "what if" story, exploring what happens to the protagonist in different universes.
Adelaide is having a difficult summer â€“ she's failing class, living apart from a brother who's in rehab, her boyfriend broke up with her, and she's maybe navigating new love.

It reminded me of *Constellations* (and indeed, it's explicitly acknowledged at the end) -- although I don't think it's as good.
It doesn't visit as many alternative branches, and I struggled to follow at a few points.
Particularly if we went down a larger branch, I couldn't always see where we'd diverged from the previous narratives.

There are some interesting thoughts on relationships -- not just romantic, but also siblings, friends, families.
