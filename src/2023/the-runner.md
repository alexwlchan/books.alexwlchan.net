A great short story set in the world of the Silo trilogy, which manages to introduce a new character and set up a new conflict in just sixty-odd pages.
There are plenty of knowing nods the original trilogy, which means it can accomplish a lot with a little â€“ for example, we know what IT is up to in a way that the protagonist doesn't.

Bonus points for a protagonist who's a gay man, and offering an explanation for why we didn't see same-sex relationships in the original trilogy.

It's part of a trilogy, and I'll definitely be reading the rest!
