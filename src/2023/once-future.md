A sci-fi retelling of the Arthurian legend, which we read for ace book club because apparently there's a minor ace character.
It was fine, and I was engaged enough to keep reading to see what happens, but it wasn't great.
The plot jumps around a bit, the characters are quite one-note, and I'm not a fan of the ace rep.

I suspect there are references to the Arthurian myth that I'm missing; I got a bit lost in the specifics of Morgana and Nin.
