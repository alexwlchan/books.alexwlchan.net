This is a heartbreaking story; Alex's wife Lisa is killed in a train crash, leaving him to look after their son Connor.
She was registered as an organ donor, and she hopes for people: Molly, Mac, Jamie, and Barbara.
Alex strike up a friendship with the four of them, but struggles to see past the echoes of his dead wife.

It's a sad story, but also a hopeful one about the value of friendship and how we can help one another.
These people were brought together by a tragic event, but their friendship is strong and touching.

Despite the heavy subject matter, I had no difficulty reading this.
I finished it quickly, and I enjoyed the pace.
Alex and Molly get most of the character development, but they all get something to do.
It was an easy read.

The cover art is gorgeous, which is why it caught my eye in the library.
I misread the blurb so I was expecting something slightly different – for Alex to meet people that Lisa helped before her death, who he'd never met – but I enjoyed the actual story regardless.
