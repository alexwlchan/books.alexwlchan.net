The sequel to [*The Watchmaker of Filigree Street*](/2022/the-watchmaker-of-filigree-street/).

Quite an enjoyable book, if a little slow in the middle.
The core mechanic (a watchmaker who can "remember" the future) is quite a clever one, and it's used deftly -- we get a proper exploration of it and how it might work, and it's worked into the plot well.

I don't care strongly for any of the characters, and I did struggle a bit in the middle, but overall I enjoyed it.
I quite like how the conflict is intensely personal.
Although it's set against the backdrop of a possible war between Japan and Russia, we do focus mostly on the people rather than the politics, and the overall stakes seem to be very personal indeed.
