Fake dating!
Sapphic romance!
Bisexual rep!

I adored Alexandria Bellefleur's first three books, so it's not much of a surprise that I liked this one too.
Tansy and Gemma are nice and easy to root for; the van Dalen family intrigue kept me in suspense throughout; it gives me the good "happily ever after" feels.  

I read it in a day, loved it.
