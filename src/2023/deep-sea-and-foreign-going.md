Interesting account of the global shipping industry, including a trip on the *Maersk Kendal* and an anti-piracy warship.
It had a bunch of new-to-me information, lots of interesting anecdotes, and I took quite a few notes.

I especially enjoyed the chapters on piracy, the merchant navy, and the effect of noise on whales.
