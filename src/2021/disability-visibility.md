I found this book [in a tweet by Anwen](https://twitter.com/Kyatic/status/1297550029809385472), and Ed gave me a copy for Christmas 2020.

It's a series of essays about being disabled, from a variety of disabled authors.
They're talking about the disabled experience, not some sort of disability 101 or primer.

The essays are grouped into four themes, and each essay is well written and contains some interesting ideas.
It's easy to read, I took a lot of notes, and came away with a lot of new ideas.
Highly recommended.
