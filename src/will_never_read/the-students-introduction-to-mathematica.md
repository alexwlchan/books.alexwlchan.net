I got a copy of this book when I was a student, because the university gave us copies of Mathematica and I was using it for my coursework.
I dipped into it, but I've never read it cover to cover.

It's been six years since I left university, I no longer use or have access to Mathematica, and if I had any serious maths to do, I'd probably use scientific Python.
(And the book has been revised by then; who knows if Mathematica still looks like what it describes.)

It turns out I tried to sell this book on Amazon years ago, and didn't get any takers, so I'm donating it to the local charity bookshop.
