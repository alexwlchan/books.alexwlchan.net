Another book that I picked up for university, when I was doing a stats course and R seemed like a good choice.
I did read some of it and I used R for a project, but I haven't used it since then and I can't anticipate a need for it in future.
It's a big book that takes up a lot of space on my shelf, so off to the charity bookshop it goes.

(Said project got rewritten in Python, but it's been so long I don't remember the details.
I strongly suspect the problem was in my R code, and refactoring either came up with something more efficient or more appropriate to the language, not R itself.)
