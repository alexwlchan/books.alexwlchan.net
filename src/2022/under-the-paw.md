A charming little book about a man who has six cats, plus a seventh at his parents, and his relationships with all of them.
I struggled to keep all the cats and houses straight (he moved multiple times and there are a _lot_ of cats), but I enjoyed it nonetheless.

I liked reading about somebody who enjoys a cat's company even more than me, and it also cemented my belief that a cat isn't right for me at the moment.
