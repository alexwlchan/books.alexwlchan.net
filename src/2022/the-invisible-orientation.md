I borrowed this from another asexual friend; I started it but didn't feel compelled to finish.

What I read seems like a solid (if verbose) primer on asexuality for somebody who's new to the topic.
It's repeating a lot of stuff I already know, so I only read the first chapter and a half.
It felt similar to [*Trans Like Me*](/reviews/trans-like-me/) in that it'd be a good book as a first introduction, but it doesn't have as much material to engage a reader who already has some lived experience and knowledge.
