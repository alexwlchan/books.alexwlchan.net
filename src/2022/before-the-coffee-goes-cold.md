This is the prequel to [*Tales from the Café*](/reviews/before-the-coffee-gets-cold-tales-from-the-cafe/), with four different stories from the café where you can travel in time:

*   a woman who goes back in time to meet her boyfriend before he moves to America
*   a wife who goes back to meet her husband before his Alzheimer's caused him to forget her
*   a woman who goes back to reconcile with her estranged sister before her sister's death
*   a mother who goes forward to meet her grown-up daughter

They're lovely stories that all made me cry in different ways, and I was glad to spend more time in this universe.
They felt slightly more connected than the stories in the sequel (but that may just be me getting familiar with the idea).

A lovely book.
