I picked up this audiobook after hearing it discussed on [The&nbsp;Incomparable #600](https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/600/).

It's an alternative Cairo in which magic was discovered in the 1860s, djinn and other otherworld creatures live alongside humans, and Egypt is a centre of political power -- and drive out the British.
Agents Hamed and Onsi are called to investigate a haunted tram car (which runs on something closer to a skyline than traditional rail tracks), and to evict the spirit that's terrorising passengers.

It's a gentle story without too many twists and turns.
The worldbuilding is fun, the plot moves along quickly, and it was easy to listen to.
I don't feel a strong pull to read the other books set in this universe, but nor would I mind picking them up sometime.
