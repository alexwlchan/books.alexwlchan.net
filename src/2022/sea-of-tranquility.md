I spotted this in the library, picked it up, was a nice quick read.
It's a sci-fi story about somebody exploring a temporal anomaly â€“ throughout history, there have been people who have a split-second out-of-time experience, temporarily transported to an airship terminal where a man plays a violin, before being yanked back to their own time and place.

We initially see it from their side -- and then from the time-travelling detective hired to investigate.

It's fine, but I didn't really connect with any of the characters and the ending didn't land.
The conclusion should work because of our emotional bond with Gaspery-Jacques Roberts, but I never felt for him and so it falls a bit flat.
