A fun queer romance to kick off the new year – it's always good when you have to start sketching diagrams because there are so many queer characters, and you need to remember how they're all related.

It wasn't spectacular, but it was solid.
I was invested in all the characters and I wanted to see them happy, which is all I really want from a romance.

It wins a serendipity award for mentioning [*Written in the Stars*](/2021/written-in-the-stars/), my copy of which was maybe two feet away when I read that paragraph.
