A love letter to reading and books â€“ Guylain Vignolles works at a book-pulping factory, but adores books and steals single pages as an act of resistance.
He reads the pages aloud to a rapt audience on his morning train, releasing the words into the world.

It's a rather charming little story.
I'm sure there are layers of symbolism and meaning that I missed on my initial read, but even on a surface reading I enjoyed it.
