This story is short but instantly recognisable; it's a slice of life about a woman whose entire life revolves around the convenience store where she works.
It's never stated explicitly in the text, but the woman is clearly autistic and likes the routines she has set up.

I thought the original book was fine; I enjoyed it more after we discussed it at book club and I got to dig into it a little deeper.
