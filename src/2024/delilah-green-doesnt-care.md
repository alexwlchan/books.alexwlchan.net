A fun prequel to [*Astrid Parker Doesn’t Fall*](/2024/astrid-parker-doesnt-fall/).
Although I knew where Astrid was going because I read the series in the wrong order, it didn't bother me at all.

Fairly standard romance fare.
I enjoyed the sisterly relationship between Delilah and the struggles of Claire being a single parent.
