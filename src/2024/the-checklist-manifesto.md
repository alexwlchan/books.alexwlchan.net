Really interesting book about how checklists are used as a tool in various industries (construction, aviation, finance) and a surgeon attempting to get them introduced in medicine.

It's a mix of stories and anecdotes about people who are already using checklists, and discussion of the theory and ideas behind them.
It has a lot of good and practical information, and delivers it in a concise and easily readable package.
It's also upfront about limitations and risks; it doesn't present checklists as some sort of easy utopia, but instead discusses the challenges you'll face if you want to do them properly.
