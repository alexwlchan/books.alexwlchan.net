A cool set of sci-fi stories! I'd read several of them before so it wasn't entirely new to me, but good to fill in the gaps.

I've been thinking about why I enjoy qntm's sci-fi, and I think it's the way every story twists at some point.
You think you know how the story is going, and then it breaks some expectation about how reality works.
The self-driving car isn't actually benevolent.
A human is really a computer program (or is it?).
The nanotech apocalypse is really a last-ditch attempt to save humanity.
And so on.

It's not quite mind-bendy as [*There Is No Antimemetics Division*](/2022/there-is-no-antimemetics-division/), but I enjoyed it all the same.
