A collection of essays about autism and mental health.

Each chapter is by a different author, and they all follow a hurt/help/hope pattern; I like that structure.
I thought it was a good selection, and the editor managed to get a reasonable range of perspectives.
I know enough autistic people that there weren't any big surprises, but I still found it an interesting read.

Unlike some of the other memoir anthologies I've read, there weren't any essays that really grabbed me – possibly because there's less overlap with my life, there was never a moment of resonance.
(I sort of wondered if there would be, because I’m ~somewhere~ in the neurodivergent probability cloud, but not parallel to any of these experiences of autism.)
