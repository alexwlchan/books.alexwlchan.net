The third and final book in the Bright Falls trilogy – fake dating with a side order of theatre kids.
Iris and Stevie learning to be able to love somebody else.

I didn't enjoy this one quite as much as the first two books?
It does manage to wrap up the trilogy in a satisfying way, but I wasn't quite as sold on the relationship.
