I really wanted to enjoy this book. It’s clear a lot of work went into the research, talking to people who did it – this isn’t a light piece of work. And this is right in my wheelhouse – WWII espionage, underground techie stuff, and the like.

Unfortunately it failed to grab me, and by halfway through the book I was really struggling to get through each chapter.

I’d love to go back and have another go at reading this, but try not to lose momentum so early on. But for now, back on the shelf.
