A very detailed breakdown of the Arctic convoys.

I’ve read several books about PQ 17 – by far the most well-known of the convoys, as it was one of the worst naval disasters of the war – but this book covers the convoys from start to finish. Detailed accounts of every convoy, the ships, the sailors and the sinkings. Highly recommended for WWII history fans – although fair warning, some of the descriptions of injuries are very graphic and detailed.

If the book has a weakness, it sometimes lacks context. It focuses a lot on the Arctic convoys, less on events elsewhere in the war. A bit more context – and some maps – would help put the individual journeys in context, and help understand their impact on the wider war.
