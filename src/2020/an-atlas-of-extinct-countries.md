Read on [the suggestion of Jonn Elledge](https://twitter.com/JonnElledge/status/1294943819625005056).

Each of the 48 extinct countries gets a couple of pages: some fun illustrations of where it was, a fun intro, and then some history of how the country came to be and not to be.
The history of countries could be dry, but there's plenty of wit and a nod to the problems of colonialism and empires.

Not detailed enough to be a reference book, but there's a thorough bibliography and it would make an excellent jumping off point for more research or reading, if it's your thing.
