I put off reading this for ages, but I’m glad I finally got to reading it.

I’m also somewhere in the trans/non-binary/genderfluid probability cloud, and I’d done a lot of reading before I transitioned – so there’s wasn’t a huge amount of new information about “what it’s like to be trans”. (And fair warning, some of it might make unpleasant reading if you’ve been the victim of transphobia yourself.)

The stuff about history and community activism was new to me, and interesting.

Throughout it’s clearly written and easy to read – I motored through the whole thing in a single session.

Highly recommended for cis people who want to learn more about what it’s like to be trans, or for trans people looking for a bit more about our history.
