A pleasant book of Manx fairy tales. I was vaguely familiar with some of these, and it covers a lot of material – I learnt quite a lot.

I don’t know much else about Manx mythology or geography, and I think that would make it easier to follow – at times I got a little lost (but that might just be the train when I was reading it?).

I’d like to reread this when I have a bit more general Manx knowledge.
