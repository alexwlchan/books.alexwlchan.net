A short book about the history of cheese, spending a few pages to focus on about a dozen different cheeses.
It's not a comprehensive history, but enough to be interesting for 100 or so pages.
The "philosophy" is confined to the last few pages, and describes creating a cheeseboard -- it's mostly a history book, which I enjoyed.
