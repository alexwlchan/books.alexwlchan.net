Fun book; the idea is to explain complicated ideas with simple words (i.e. the most common ten-thousand works in English).
The illustrations are the usual XKCD style, with a good blend of information and wit.

My one frustration is that sometimes I'd read about a cool idea I wanted to know more about, and I had to "decode" the simple words to get something I could look up.
But I think that's deliberate â€“ part of the point is to show how specialist terminology can be when useful at times.
Simple language is good, up to a point.

Because of the density of information, I could only read a few pages at time, but I enjoyed them as I did.
