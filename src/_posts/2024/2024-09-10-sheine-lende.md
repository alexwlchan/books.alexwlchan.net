The prequel to [*Elatsoe*](/2023/elatsoe/), which was one of my favourites last year.
It captures all the magic of the original, with the fun new mechanic of "mimic rings".
I like how it builds on the same ideas and themes, but works as a standalone story.

## Favourite quotes

P144:

> But Lorenza hadn't used the ghost waking technique in mone than decade then, and like many arts, practice was critical. As the hours passed, and her mother's voice became raspy and faded, Shane wondered whether she'd just witnessed the death of knowledge. Through disuse, had Lorenza forgotten how to wake a ghost? It was a technique Shane's heroic ancestor had developed, a power that generations of mothers had passed along to their daughters. With Grandma Bee gone, and Lorenza struggling, who would teach Shane one day?
