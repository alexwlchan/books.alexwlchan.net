A cute teenage romance that had some lovely use of colour (for example, the red/blue of the Korean/Chinese lions).
I have nothing specific to say; I enjoyed this one.

I first saw this book on a shelf in a library in rural Vermont.
I wrote it down, and when I came home I got it out of my local library.
