This is a story about Meg, a woman who gets comeuppance against people who've transgressed social norms -- cheaters, clingy friends, annoying co-workers.
She's built her trade as somebody who can read people and persuade them to do things, a sort of Sherlock Holmes turned confidence trickster.

The story is fun but the plot is simple and the characters are a bit one-note.

The cover of this made me think this would be a light-hearted romance, so I was pleasantly surprised when it wasn't.
