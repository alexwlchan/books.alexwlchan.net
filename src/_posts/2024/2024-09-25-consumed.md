Interesting book about the problems of fast fashion and exploitation in the garment industry; its history and how it's tied to colonialism; steps we can take to be more conscientious consumers and push back on these issues.
It discusses racism and intersectionality, and how it affects people beyond the pieces of fabric.

I struggled to focus on reading this book -- some of these topics are familiar to me already, and there wasn't quite enough new material.
Perhaps I'm also not the target audience; my records show I've bought five items of clothing this year?
The author is writing as if it's common to be buying that many items a *month*.
(Which is not to say I'm perfect, but I do seem to have missed out on "fast fashion".)

That said, I'm glad the book exists and would recommend it.

It reminded me of [*Wasteland*](/2024/wasteland/), which has a much deeper exploration of the second-hand clothing market in Ghana.
