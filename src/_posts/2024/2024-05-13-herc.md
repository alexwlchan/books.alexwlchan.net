A really fun retelling of the myth of Hercules.
It's told entirely in the first person, with the perspective shifting each chapter -- we hear from all the people who've run into him, wreaking havoc in their lives before moving on somewhere else.

There's some beautiful writing in here, especially around grief and trauma -- and there is so much of it around Hercules.

I enjoyed the switching perspectives, but it did make it tricker to sit down and really drill through it.
That might just be my brain, but I could only read it in short stints.
But I was also taking notes between chapters, which really helped later in the book when I remembered who certain characters were and what I'd read about them previously.

I'm biased because the author is a dear friend, and also guilty that it's taken me so long to read it. ðŸ™ˆ
I'm glad I finally did!
