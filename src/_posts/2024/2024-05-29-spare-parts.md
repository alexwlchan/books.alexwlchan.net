A chilling and spooky radio drama, showing the origins of the Cybermen on Mondas.
Even though I knew the premise going in, it was still creepy to listen to it happen -- it wasn't always obvious what was part of the Cybermen plan, and what was part of the beaten-down Mondasian society.
The voice acting is great and there's plenty of suspense throughout.

I listened to the whole thing in a single sitting.

I've been told for years that this is one of the best Cybermen stories; now I understand why.
