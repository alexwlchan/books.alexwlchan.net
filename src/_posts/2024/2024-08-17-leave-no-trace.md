A fun thriller with a hint of romance.
Maya is a speech therapist who's assigned to work with Lucas, a nineteen year-old who's just emerged from the wilderness after he and his father disappeared a decade prior.
She has to work out what happened to him, and why he's so eager to escape civilisation and return to the woods.

The book was a good exercise in balance.
The plot dropped hints about where it was going, so I was surprised but not shocked by the conclusion -- nothing came out of left field.
Their lives are more intertwined than it initially appears, but not so much as to feel implausible.
And the romance felt a bit stretched to me, but they're young and inexperienced and I could look past it.

Overall I enjoyed it; it was a quick and easy read, and I'd read her other books.
