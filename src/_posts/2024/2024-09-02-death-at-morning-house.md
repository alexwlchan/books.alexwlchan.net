A fun murder mystery, split across past and present.

In the past, you have the Ralston family and seven children who exist in slightly peculiar circumstances -- raised by a rich, eugenicist father who keeps them on a private island and indulges their education.
Local lore says the family are cursed, after a series of accidents saw them wiped out within a couple of years.

In the present, you have Marlowe, who skips town to become a tour guide at the Ralston House after a disastrous first date where a house burns down.
She's joining a group of friends, filling the space of a boy who recently died.

Initially these seem like accidents, but we quickly realise that they're murders.
Although the two murderers aren't connected directly, there are parallels and running themes between them both, which helps tie the two plotlines together.
I liked the overall resolution, and I felt like enough clues were laid along the way -- I didn't guess correctly, but I can see the text supported the answer.

The writing is gentle and easy, and it was a compelling read.
I wouldn't mind reading it again at some point, to see what I missed.
