This is a comic book story told in prose form, about a genius who creates superweapons, genetically enhanced dinosaurs, and other such fanciful inventions and strafes at the oversight of superheroes and world governments.
They sometimes work alongside the heroes, and are sometimes branded as a villain by the world.

I thought it was fine but it didn't really grab me; I clearly missed something because this was fairly popular among everyone else at book club.
I didn't really care about the protagonist and I found it tricky to follow in places -- I admire the adaptation to write a comic as words, but it didn't work for me.

There's an extended discussion about how they dislike cheese which is apparently a metaphor for asexuality, which I completely missed.
