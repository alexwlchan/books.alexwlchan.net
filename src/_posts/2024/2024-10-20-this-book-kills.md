Fun little murder mystery set in a boarding school.
The murder is a copycat -- copying from Jess's short story, where she came up with a particularly unusual calling card of the murderer (the words "help me" spelt out in twigs by the victim's body).

Lots of twists and turns, and I was kept guessing to the end -- all the strands tie together in a satisfying way, but not one I could predict.
