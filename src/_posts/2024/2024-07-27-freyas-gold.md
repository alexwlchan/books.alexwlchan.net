Short and sweet sequel to [*Looking for Emily*](/2022/looking-for-emily/), set in the same town of Edge but featuring separate characters.
(Or if there are characters from the first book, I'd forgotten them.)

Freya lives with her Granny Kate at the local B&B, and gets suspicious when Ms Oleander comes to town.
Ostensibly her plan is to buy the town and redevelop it, but really she wants to demolish it and dig for hidden treasure beneath.
Freya and her two friends Teddy and Lin resolve to find it first, to save their town.

Apparently I got "chills" when I read the first book; none of that here.
It was still plenty of fun, but didn't grab me in the same way.
