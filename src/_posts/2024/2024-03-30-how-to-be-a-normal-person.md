This book is a puzzle.

It's a romance novel where one of the protagonists is ace, so it should be right up my street -- and that's why it was chosen for Ace Book Club.
And in parts it was endearing and lovely, and in other parts it was frustrating and it took me a long time to warm up to it.

I can't put my finger on why this book didn't grab me, but it was a struggle to get through.
