The sequel to [*Going Dark*](/2024/silo-49-going-dark/), where Silo 49 has survived but with a warped knowledge of its own history.
We follow Marina, a historian, who tries to understand what happened in the past.
This book has some interesting explorations of knowledge and memory, and I liked being able to contrast the events I read about in the previous book with what they "know" happened in their history.
