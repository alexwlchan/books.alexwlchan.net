Overall I enjoyed this a lot – a good luck into the mistakes made by Pixar along the way. Very much the “anti-business” book. Can’t shake the feeling that at times, it’s been a little airbrushed to paint Pixar in a good way, but still very interesting. In particular, no mention of any mistakes made *after* a film was released.
