Plot summary: the protagonist, Murderbot, is on contract to some humans who are doing mining research on a new planet -- from one of three companies on the planet.
When one of the other companies goes quiet, they realise the third is trying to kill them, and Murderbot has to protect its clients.
The book ends with one of the clients buying Murderbot from its parent company, at which point it heads off on a mission of its own.
