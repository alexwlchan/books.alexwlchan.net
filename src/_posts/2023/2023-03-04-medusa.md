A modern retelling of Medusa's story -- sharing her life with Perseus, as they talk from either side of the rock.
She's not a monster; she's a young woman crushed under impossible expectations and trying to make her way in the world.

Two especially nice touches are creating names and personalities for her snakes, which she clearly has a kinship with -- and talks about being loathe to give them up now, even if that was an option -- and giving both her and Perseus dogs.

It's only short; I read it quickly and it's lovely writing.
