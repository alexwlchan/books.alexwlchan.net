Some fun imagined conversations in the corridors of power during Theresa May's premiership.
Michael Gove as an Eldritch horror.
An army of ducks hired to ferry goods across the channel.
Gavin Williamson's obsession with *Warhammer 40K*.

It's told in the style of a far-future historian looking back, with appropriately misinformed commentary on what the twenty-first century was like.
