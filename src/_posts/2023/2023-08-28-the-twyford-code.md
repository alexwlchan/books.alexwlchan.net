A decent enough crime story, told as a series of audio transcripts.
Most of the story has twists and turns and are built around the idea of the "Twyford code", a secret supposedly hidden in the text of a series of children's novels.
It includes stolen gold, a hoax from World War II, and mysterious men who want to prevent the person recording the tapes from finding out the truth.

The transcripts felt like a modern version of an epistolatory novel; I thought it would bother me more than it did.

The story is inconsistent and we learn not to trust the protagonist -- there's a fairly major twist at the end, and how well the book work rests on the quality of that twist.
It mostly worked for me, but it did have a taste of "and it was all a dream".
I wasn't entirely sold.
