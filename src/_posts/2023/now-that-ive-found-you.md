A rather charming little romance about Vinnie and Ellen – a taxi driver raising two kids as a single father, and a former doctor who has mental and physical scarring after an accident.
The book switches between their two points of view and we see how they're changing each other's lives for the better.

I took a while to warm up to it but I was enjoying it by the end.
Some of the surrounding characters feel a bit simplistic, but the main characters all worked well for me.
