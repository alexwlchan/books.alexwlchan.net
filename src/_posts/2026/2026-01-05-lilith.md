This is a modern and feminist retelling of Lilith, a character I’m not very familiar with.

In this story, the mother god Asherah is quickly subdued by Yahweh, a patriarchal god who wants to subjugate women, acts as the only god, and teaches Adam to be ambitious and dominant. The story weaves across millennia as Lilith tries to rescue Asherah and her lessons of motherhood and caring.

I enjoyed this, and I learned a lot about characters I’d never come across – not just Lilith, but also Jezebel, Samael, and the gnostic gospels. The book has a fictionalised version of them, but includes afternotes that explain the more “factual” versions.

I did find some of the prose overly descriptive and colourful at points, but that’s not uncommon for this sort of story. It reminded me of Greek translations in school.

I bought this because the author was doing a signing event with a friend, and it’s not something I think I’d have read otherwise. I’m glad I did.
