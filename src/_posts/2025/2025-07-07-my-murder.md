A thriller with an unusual twist -- Lou was murdered by a serial killer, but then cloned and returned to her former life.
It's an interesting reflection identity and motherhood, as the new Lou tries to find her place in a life that was lived by somebody else.

She has a weekly meeting with the four other victims of this serial killer, and gets drawn into a mystery of exactly what happened to her -- she has no memory of the murder itself, or anything leading up to the event.
It goes in some directions I didn't expect, and I was gripped trying to work out what actually happened.
(I was, of course, completely wrong in my guess.)
