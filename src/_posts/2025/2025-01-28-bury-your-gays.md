A fun little horror story set in Hollywood, where a queer screenwriter Misha finds himself pursued by his own creations.
It also touches on the risks posed by AI in creative fields.

It reads like a movie turned into a book, and horror isn't usually my genre, but I could enjoy it.
Some the logic is a bit more movie handwaving than I usually like, but it worked for me here.

I read this for book club and I enjoyed the discussion afterwards.
