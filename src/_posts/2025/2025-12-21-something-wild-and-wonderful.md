I gave up on this book when I got to the first sex scene, and realised that I was continuing out of obligation rather than enjoyment.
I wasn't rooting for Alexei and Ben, and I don't care if they fall in love with each other.
I've read the other two books in this trilogy and I recognise the side characters!
And I still don't care.

My disinterest is a combination of mlm romances and instant "omg this person is so hot" attraction -- they're not things I experience, and I don't particularly care for them in books.
