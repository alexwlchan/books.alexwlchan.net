A collection of short stories about mermaids, sirens, and other creatures that live under the sea.
I bought this primarily because I like Darcie Little Badger's writing; it turns out that I'm not that interested in stories about mermaids.
It was a bit of a slog to read, and most of the stories weren't really grabbing my attention.

I wonder if that's partly my fault -- I didn't start writing notes until halfway through the book, and that's when I started noticing the deeper meaning.
There's a lot of parallels between being queer and mixed-race that aren't subtle, but took me a while to notice.

I'm struggling to write anything useful here, because I just don't have any strong feelings about this book.
It was fine, but it's not something I can see myself reading again.
