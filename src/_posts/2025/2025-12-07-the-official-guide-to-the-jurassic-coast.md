Some geology and history about Dorset and East Devon, two places I have a vague family connection to.
I was pleasantly surprised by the detail; I thought it would be more of a light-touch tourist guide, but it does describe the area in depth.
Plus it introduced me to Mary Anning, a paleontologist who discovered many fossils in the area.
