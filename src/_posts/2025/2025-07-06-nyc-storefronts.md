A charming book about some of the smaller, quirkier stores in NYC.
I bought this on my trip to New York in February 2025, and it's to my shame that I only read it months later from my sofa in the UK, when I'm unable to visit any of these places.

The illustrations are delightful and human, and I feel like I know a little more of New York now.
I know New Yorkers love their city, and this book helped me understand why.
