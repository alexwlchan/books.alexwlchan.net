A fun and intriguing royal mystery â€“ James is the first Black heir to the British throne, and somebody inside the Palace is leaking secrets to discredit and undermine him.

I'm not massively interested in the Royal family, so I didn't expect to get into the book, but I was hooked quickly!
There are layers of intrigue and deception, because by ascending to king, James finds himself unable to trust anybody, even family members.
It's such a web of lies and I was thoroughly confused by the end of it -- I did work out who the villain was, but I was pretty late in the book.

I can't remember where I first heard of Benjamin Dean, but I'd definitely read more of his books after this.
