A sci-fi mystery set in the small town of Muddy Gap, where Denver Bryant reviews pies for their online blog -- until green lights appear in the sky, people act strangely and disappear, and the local geometry goes very wonky.

I wasn't gripped, and I think I got lost somewhere in the middle -- I missed the point where we established the existence of a single "Dreamer", the alien causing this all -- but it was enjoyable enough, and I did finished.

I bought this on the strength of the pun in the title, and that was a good decision.
