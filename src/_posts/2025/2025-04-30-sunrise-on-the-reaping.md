A prequel to the Hunger Games series about Haymitch Abernathy, the District 12 victor from the second Quarter Quell.

Prequels are tricky because we as the audience know how they're going to end, and so it depends on how well they get to the destination.
Characters and motivation, not plot and surprises.

This book largely succeeded for me. 
I knew that Haymitch would end up friendless and alcoholic, but I enjoyed the series of events that got us there -- meeting the other Tributes, his Covey love Lenore Dove, and his Capitol mentors and helpers.
It's tragic to realise how close he came to escaping unscathed, and to see more of the cruelty of President Snow.

I'm not sure the rebellion plotline worked for me, but overall I found it a solid addition to the series, and I'm glad I read it.
