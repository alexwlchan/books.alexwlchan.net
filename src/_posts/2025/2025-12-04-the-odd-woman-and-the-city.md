An oddball memoir of life and loneliness in New York, of being the "odd woman" who doesn't have friendships or romance in the conventional sense.
I feel like this should appeal to me, but it didn't really land, and I finished it more out of obligation than engagement.
I'll admit I'd never heard of Gornick before; maybe I'd enjoy this more if I'd read some of her other work.
