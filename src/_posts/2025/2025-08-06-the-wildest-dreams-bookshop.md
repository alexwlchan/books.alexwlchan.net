A charming and easy novel, set in a small Cornish village.
Anna thinks her future is in tatters, and she's staying with her aunt Josie for the summer, helping to run a bookshop.
She's initially unimpressed by her temporary home, but quickly finds the charm of the community.

I thought this was a romance, but that's a side plot at best -- Anna's ex-boyfriend Max is a non-entity for most of the book, and her flirtation with Jacob is overshadowed by her work in the bookshop.

I enjoyed it, found it an easy read, but nothing amazing.
