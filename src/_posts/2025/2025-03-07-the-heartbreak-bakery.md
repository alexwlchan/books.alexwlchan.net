A cute little romance-ish book about Syd, who works in a queer-friendly bakery in Austin.
After a bad breakup, Syd inadvertently bakes a batch of magical brownies that cause couples to break up, and they have to come up with new baked goods to repair the ruined romances.

Syd is a fun character, and the handful of other bakers and queer acquaintainces are good too.
It didn't especially grab me, maybe because Syd is so young -- just seventeen, and dealing with the angst of a first breakup -- I was more drawn to the older characters.

It's sweet and fluffy, like a delicious baked good, and I'm looking forward to discussing it at book club in a few weeks.
