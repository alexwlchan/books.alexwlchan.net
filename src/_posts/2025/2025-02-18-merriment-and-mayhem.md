This book is the reason I picked up the *Under the Mistletoe*, because I usually like Alexandria Bellefleur's writing -- but it was another story I struggled to engage with.
Somebody has a cooking disaster and fills her apartment with smoke, and an attractive firefighter shows up to help her out.
We're thrust into the romance too quickly, with minimal build-up, and I wasn't excited.
