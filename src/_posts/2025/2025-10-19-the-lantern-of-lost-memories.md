A sweet little book about an afterlife in a photography studio, where you're shown photos taken from every year of your life, and have to choose one photo per year to make a lantern of your life.

It reminded me of the "Coffee Goes Cold" books -- Japanese short stories about somebody's life, viewed through a new lens.
The proprietor, Mr Hirasaka, takes people back into the past to take one final photograph of their life, which is how we see their world in more detail.

It didn't quite tug at my heartstrings like other stories in this vein, but I still enjoyed it.
