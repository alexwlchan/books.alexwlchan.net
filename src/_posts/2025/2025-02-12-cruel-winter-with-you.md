A pleasant but somewhat unremarkable romance -- during a storm, a woman is forced to shelter in the home of a childhood friend who has feelings for her, and still does, but a breakdown of communication meant they both thought the other hated them.
I'm not a massive fan of "bad communication" as a trope and this wasn't a fantastic instance of it.
