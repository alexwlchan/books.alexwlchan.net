A delightful book about finding Hester Leggatt, a story I watched from the sidelines and now get to learn about in more detail.

I am obviously biased because a bunch of my friends wrote this book, but even so, I found it well-written and charming, weaving an excellent narrative from the historical discoveries that tie back to the original musical.
The skill is not merely finding all this information, but organising it into a coherent and readable story of Hester's life.
