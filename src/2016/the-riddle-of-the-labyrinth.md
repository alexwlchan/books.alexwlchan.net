The story of the decoding of Cretan Linear B. I knew fragments about it already, but I’d never read the complete story. There’s enough information and the linguistic and cryptographic aspects to be technically interesting, but it maintains a strong narrative and isn’t just a reference book.

It’s split into three parts, each focusing on person who was involved in the decipherment, but it feels like there’s a strong emphasis on Alice Kober. A woman whose contributions were largely overlooked in favour of her male peers. Shocking, I know.

Anyway, I enjoyed and would recommend to other classicists.
