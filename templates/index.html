<h1>Welcome to my book tracker!</h1>

<p>
  This is a small app I created to track the books I've read, inspired by a <a href="https://github.com/tessalt/books">similar book tracker</a> made by <a href="https://twitter.com/tessthornton">Tessa Thornton</a>.
</p>

<p>Here are a few books I&rsquo;ve read recently:</p>

<div class="books_by_year">
  {% for review_entry in reviews|slice(end = 5) %}
    {% include "_review_entry.html" %}
  {% endfor %}
  <a href="/reviews">read more reviews &rarr;</a>
</div>
{% endblock %}
