  # This daily rebuild is to avoid GitHub Actions purging the site cache,
  # because regenerating all the image thumbnails would be a PITA:
  #
  #     GitHub will remove any cache entries that have not been
  #     accessed in over 7 days.
  #
  # See https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows
