<h1>Welcome to my book tracker!</h1>

<p>
  This is a small app I created to track <a href="/reviews/">the books I&rsquo;ve read</a>, inspired by a <a href="https://debugger.medium.com/tech-savvy-readers-are-designing-their-own-better-versions-of-goodreads-aac96934d79">similar book tracker</a> made by <a href="https://twitter.com/tessthornton">Tessa Thornton</a>.
</p>

<p>Here are a few books I&rsquo;ve read recently:</p>

<div class="books_by_year">
  {% for review_entry in recent_reviews %}
    {% include review_entry.html %}
  {% endfor %}
  <a href="/reviews/">read more reviews &rarr;</a>
</div>
