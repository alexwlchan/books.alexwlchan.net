This is a children's book that I picked up from an Oxfam store; although it's very simple it is an interesting view into British railways of the 1970s.
Some aspects would seem familiar or antiquated to the modern reader (like trains that can reach 100mph, or [the APT][apt] as the height of technology); others have faded into something few people are likely to know (such as the underground post office train).
