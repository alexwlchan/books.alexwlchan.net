A story about the bookshop *Les Vraies Richesses*, run by the publisher and editor Edmond Charlot.
We cut between Charlot's diaries as he's setting up the shop and his publishing company, and a young man Ryad who's been tasked with dismantling the now-defunct shop.

It's a charming little book.

When I picked it up, I thought it was fiction -- but Edmond Charlot was a real person and the book shop really existed (or did), so I'm not sure how much is historical fact and how much is creative interpretation.
